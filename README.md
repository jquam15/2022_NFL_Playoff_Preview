# 2022_NFL_Playoff_Preview

Welcome to my 2022 NFL Playoff Preview. Here I look at historical data on net yards per pass attempt and use my findings to provide a playoff preview.

**To see my post please visit my website via the following link [2022 NFL Playoff Preview](https://jquam15.github.io/2022_NFL_Playoff_Preview.html). This github repository provides the code for my analysis if you'd like to see how I did it, but I would encourage you to read the post.**

I would also highly encourage you to check out the rest of my work on my [website](https://jquam15.github.io/)!

The folders each contain files that are either not applicable to the 2022 preview, or were pre-processing steps:

* 2020 contains a basic analysis of the 2020 season
* data_processing combines several files into the ones that I ended up using (combined_offense.csv and combined_defense.csv)
* scrape_data contains the files I used to scrape data. I did this when I was first learning to code as a way of practicing, so it is very crude code that I would not recommend anyone to run (it creates a TON of files and takes a long time to run). It was an important step to get the combined files that I used, so I included it, but I would highly recommend just using the combined_offense.csv and combined_defense.csv that are already uploaded. The 2022.ipynb file on the main repo page provides a much better way to scrape data (albeit for only 2022 passing stats).

**Thanks for checking it out, and I hope you learn something!**
